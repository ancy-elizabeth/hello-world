# hello-world
I am an MSc Data Science student with a strong foundation in Bayesian Data Analysis, Linear Models, and Statistical Inference. My academic journey involves leveraging R for Data Analytics, working on projects such as spatial data analysis of sports centers in Cork and Dublin, as well as an in-depth study of the Olympics Fencing dataset.

Beyond data science, I am expanding my technical expertise in web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic applications. My problem-solving approach is data-driven, detail-oriented, and accuracy-focused, ensuring that every analysis and implementation is both precise and insightful.

Currently based in Maynooth, Ireland, I am continuously refining my skills in statistical modeling, data visualization, and software development. I am always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies, striving to enhance my expertise across multiple domains.
